Line following robot
The task given was to construct an entirely self-contained line following robot. The final product was restricted to a length and width of 250mm and to a height of 200mm. The robot had to follow a 200mm â€“ wide white line on a matt-black base (MDF and blackboard paint). The track comprised of straight line, arcs and perpendicular crossovers.
